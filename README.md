## Description

Technigram's main goal is to create a platform for like minded people to share their computer builds with each other and give feedback, recommendations or just chat about something they are interested in. Custom PC building is a niche enthusiast market, where many builders are very passionate about building PC's for performance, builds on a budget, aesthetics, or any other combination of things. Technigram also includes a convenient tech news page to keep you up to date on the latest in the tech world.

Our motivation for this project came about when all of us were just talking about our computer builds. All of us were excited to see what parts the others were using and how they looked. So we thought, what better way to show them off than to create a website for doing exactly that.

Technigram was built with the MERN stack, utilizing Apollo GraphQL with NodeJS and Express for the server. MongoDB was used to create the database. Technigram was styled using React for structure, React Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling, and drew from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to obtain tech news from many different tech publications such as WCCF Tech, Engadget, Eurogamer and Gizmodo.
